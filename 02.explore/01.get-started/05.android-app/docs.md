An unreleased version of High Fidelity is currently [available to download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.highfidelity.hifiinterface) for Daydream-enabled Android devices.
 
>>>> Compatibility: The app is designed for Daydream-ready phones only. However, it cannot be used in Daydream View and is only available as a 2d application.
 
As an unreleased app, it does not have the full functionality of the desktop or VR version of High Fidelity. However, you are able to explore a number of worlds, attend events, change avatars, and connect with friends directly from your phone.
